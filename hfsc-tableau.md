# Custom Presentation & Data Visualizations for HFSC in Collaboration with Slant Communications

## Project Description

The Home Fire Sprinkler Coalition is a nonprofit dedicated to providing educational material about fire sprinklers. I was brought in to develop an automated slide deck for Fire Departments to present to city councils.

Using data from their own jurisdiction, departments can customize and generate a PowerPoint presentation from an input form. Tableau is used to generate the visualizations.
